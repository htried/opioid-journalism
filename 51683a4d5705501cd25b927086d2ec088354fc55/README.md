# Welcome the Rhode Island Opioid Data Journalism Project

Hi there! We're a multidisciplinary group of data scientists and journalists from Brown University, working together to investigate the opioid crisis in Rhode Island through a rich variety of data sources. With the expertise and technical know-how of data scientists, we hope to dig into daunting datasets to create evocative and informative graphics on the opioid crisis. Journalists will then take these findings and contextualize them with human stories. We hope to continue working on these stories through the summer, with the intention of pitching and publishing them in fall 2020.

### Datasets
We've looked at many different data sources to get a deep understanding of the opioid crisis in Rhode Island:
- ARCOS
- Census data
- Publicly available state data on overdose deaths, emergency room visits, and naloxone use and distribution
- Detailied overdose records for the city of Providence
- Publicly available doctor payment data
- Digitized court records since 1980
- Lawsuits against opioid manufacturers like Rhodes Pharmaceuticals and Purdue Pharma
- (to come) Medicaid prescription utilization

### Tools
We're using several different tools to store, process, and visualize data:
- Google Drive (for shared data storage)
- Google Colab (for shared data processing scripts)
- Pandas (for data manipulation and filtering)
- d3.js (for mapping and visualizations)
- Tableau (for mapping and visualizations)
- Github Pages (for mocking up what articles will eventually look like and putting images/graphics with text)
