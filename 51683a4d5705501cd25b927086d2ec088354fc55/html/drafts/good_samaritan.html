<h1>Rhode Island's Good Samaritan Law</h1>
<h2>Is It Saving Lives or Protecting Drug Dealers?</h2>
<h3>By Gaya Gupta</h3>

<img src="img/.jpg" alt="" class="center">
<h5></h5>

<p>
Rhode Island’s Good Samaritan Law, which immunizes people from being prosecuted for drug offenses when they call for emergency help, has started a movement to shift the state’s focus from prosecuting opioid users to getting them help. The law, first enacted in 2012,  has also resulted in tying police departments’ hands when it comes to arresting some drug offenders, even dealers.<br><br>
But according to studies, relatively few people know about it — eight years since its passage — so people are still scared to call the police even if they are witnessing a fatal overdose.  And even among those who know about the law, many feel they will not be protected in certain situations. Over the last three years, the attorney general’s office reported that 61 people were prosecuted for non-drug-related crimes in Rhode Island after seeking medical assistance for an overdose.<br><br>
With nearly a quarter of emergency assistance calls resulting in criminal charges, the protections afforded by Rhode Island’s Good Samaritan protections are not only limited but also under intense debate. Law enforcement officials agree that the act is meant to save lives rather than prosecute addicts, but some disagree about the extent to which drug offenders should be protected.<br><br>
“There’s a balance between criminal enforcement and public health,” said Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Neronha in a recent interview.  “When it comes to making sure someone doesn’t die from an overdose, this statute is meant to encourage people to call 911 by letting them know they can’t be prosecuted based on evidence that is obtained after they call.”<br><br>
Though Neronha agrees that the Good Samaritan Law should protect not only the person calling for help but also the person overdosing, he believes that the law should not immunize those responsible for circulating lethal drugs such as opioids, only people found in possession of drugs for personal use.<br><br>
“We’re not interested in putting someone in jail for drugs,” Neronha said.  “We focus on people who are significant drug dealers, people who possess narcotics with the intent to deliver. Most of our focus is on people who distribute large amounts of narcotics, worth anywhere from $1,200 for an ounce to $60,000 for a kilo.”<br><br>
The protection afforded by the Good Samaritan Law was most recently used to defend Daniel DiSalvo, a 38-year-old man from South Kingstown who was found on December 21, 2017, with 5.9 pounds of marijuana –– well over Rhode Island’s 2.5-ounce limit –– when two witnesses called for rescue teams after finding DiSalvo unresponsive and blue. Several weeks later, police arrested DiSalvo and charged him with two offenses: possession with intent to deliver marijuana and and possession with intent to deliver THC, the psychoactive component of marijuana. He faced up to 30 years in prison with fines ranging from $3,000 to $100,000 for both of the offenses the police charged him with.<br><br>
But last February, Superior Court Judge Melanie W. Thunberg, a former state prosecutor, ruled that the Good Samaritan law protected DiSalvo from prosecution and dismissed the case. . Neither of the two witnesses who called for help were prosecuted either.<br><br>
In tossing the case, Thunberg said that the crime of unlawful possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, which is what DiSalvo was charged with, is “clearly a crime ‘related to the possession of a controlled substance,’” which The Good Samaritan Law immunizes.<br><br>
DiSalvo’s lawyer, Nicholas J. Parrillo, said that the ruling would ensure that people don’t delay in seeking help during a medical emergency, taking “hesitation out of the equation.”<br><br>
Even though he disagreed with her decision, Neronha’s office ultimately decided not to appeal Thunberg’s dismissal of the DiSalvo case, given that the case involved relatively small amounts of marijuana and hash oil. Neronha predicts there will likely be more opportunities to litigate the issue in the future, and that he might have a better chance of narrowing the court’s interpretation of the law if the case involved a drug dealer who was trafficking large amounts of opioids, such as heroin or fentanyl.</p>
<p class="pagebreak">+++</p>
<p>
Each year, Neronha is required under the Good Samaritan law to submit a report to the General Assembly describing the number of incidents where the law was used to prevent a drug charge from being brought by the police.<br><br>
In 2018, there were 76 such incidents, he reported. In 2019, there were 70.  And last year, during the COVID-19 pandemic, when there were more fatal overdoses in Rhode Island than ever before — there were 134 — almost twice the number of non-prosecuted cases reported by police the year before. This is not surprising given a trend in Rhode Island police departments not to bring criminal charges against people they find overdosing if they don’t appear to be drug dealers.<br><br>
“For a very long time, the Providence Police, even prior to the ‘Good Sam’ Law, were using great discretion not to charge on those situations where individuals were clearly chronically addicted,” Providence Police Chief Colonel Hugh T. Clements Jr. said in a recent interview.  “For the most part, we have opted not to charge criminally for [a] mere, small possession of drugs.”<br><br>
But many people still worry that a call to police reporting an overdose could land them — or someone they are trying to help — in prison.<br><br>
The Good Samaritan Law does not protect people from being charged with any sort of crime. There were 19 people in 2018, 14 in 2019, and  28 in 2020 prosecuted for non-drug offenses as a direct result of a 911 call for medical assistance.<br><br>
In 2019, the Providence Police charged nine people resulting from a call for emergency assistance: one for a firearms-related offense, another for assault against fire/rescue personnel, and seven for operating a vehicle under the influence of drugs.<br><br>
Clements said that although his department prioritizes getting drugs off the streets rather than making arrests, such traffic and firearm violations can harm others and those who commit such offenses need to be held accountable.<br><br>
But he firmly believes that there’s more to be done to reduce the number of overdoses in Rhode Island each year, especially in terms of informing the public of the Good Samaritan Law’s protections.<br><br>
Fear of police involvement is a major barrier to calling for assistance in an overdose, says Michelle McKenzie, a public health researcher at Miriam Hospital in Providence and director of Prevent Overdosing Naloxone Intervention (PONI). According to a 2018 study funded by the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) and led by McKenzie, even though 70% of participants — all drug users in Rhode Island — called 911 while witnessing an overdose, most do not stay at the scene until EMTs or the police arrive, and many did not seem to fully comprehend what exactly the law protects.<br><br>
“I’ll call 911, I’ll give you a Narcan, and I’ll leave,” one user said.<br><br>
“Although I know that the law exists, and I know that they’re not supposed to [arrest], I kind of will think twice about calling the cops and staying on the scene,” said another.<br><br>
Many who do stay long enough for the police to arrive are treated with disapproval and anger, according to Dennis Bailer, Overdose Prevention Program Manager at Project Weber/RENEW, a harm reduction and recovery program in Rhode Island. Some feel threatened by police who arrive on the scene, he asserted, while others are arrested for both drug and non-drug related charges.<br><br>
In fact, many of the 100 people surveyed by Community Overdose Engagement (CODE) — a summit of leaders from Rhode Island hosted by Governor Gina Raimondo to address the opioid epidemic — said they would not call 911 during an overdose because they had outstanding arrest warrants. This can lead to more fatalities if the witness doesn’t administer naloxone (also known as Narcan), a medication that reverses the effects of an overdose.</p>
<p class="pagebreak">+++</p>
<p>
But the biggest problem may be lack of understanding. According to a RIDOH survey conducted in 2016, 88% of active illicit drug users described the Good Samaritan law as ‘very important or absolutely necessary’ in their decision to call 911 during an overdose, but barely over 50% of the survey respondents even knew what or who the law protected.<br><br>
Kathryn Power, Director of Rhode Island’s Department of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities & Hospitals, acknowledged the importance of educating the public on the “nuances, importance, and ramifications” of the Good Samaritan Law, and is currently working with different police departments and police associations across the state to address the opioid epidemic. She believes that the police should use more restraint in charging people who call 911 to report an overdose.<br><br>
Overdose prevention groups in Rhode Island such as Project Weber/RENEW are working with RIDOH to increase awareness about the protections afforded by the law, particularly in Spanish-speaking and other minority communities who have a deep distrust of the police.  Even though Bailer and others at Project Weber/RENEW believe that the Good Samaritan Law could afford more protection, they still believe that educating more Rhode Islanders about the law will help save more lives.</p>
<p class="pagebreak">+++</p>
<p>
Rhode Island is one of 45 states to have a Good Samaritan Law centered on drug overdoses. Maine, Texas, Wyoming, Oklahoma, and Kansas do not.<br><br>
Who and what the law protects varies by state — Vermont’s version of the Good Samaritan Law is the most protective, providing immunity for any drug-related offense — including drug distribution.<br><br>
But even Vermont is struggling to educate its population about the law’s protections. Even in situations when someone might die from an overdose, Vermonters would rather call friends to administer naloxone than the police.  Many in the state report that they do not trust the police enough to call 911 for fear they would be arrested anyway, said Grace Keller, a program coordinator at a naloxone distribution site in Vermont called Safe Recovery.<br><br>
She recommends educating opioid users at syringe exchange programs and working with law enforcement to mitigate the “stigma and shame” that may prevent people from getting help during an overdose. She acknowledged that it will take time to repair the community’s fear of involving the police, but involving Vermont’s law enforcement in community outreach could encourage more people to trust the law’s protections.<br><br>
While Rhode Island’s Good Samaritan law is not as broad in its protections as Vermont’s, it is one of only two states to provide immunity from prosecution to parole and probation violators, a clause that was added when the law was renewed in 2016, after its three-year sunset provision ended. Many of those who are witness to an overdose are on parole or probation and risk violating the terms of their release by getting caught with someone using drugs, according to Steve Detoy, Director of Government and Public Affairs at the Rhode Island Medical Society and one of the authors of Rhode Island’s Good Samaritan law.<br><br>
But overdose prevention advocates across Rhode Island don’t think the 2016 amendments to the law went far enough. They are seeking to amend the law to provide even greater immunity.  A team at Rhode Island’s Department of Health that reviews data and studies trends regarding accidental overdose deaths recently announced at a Rhode Island Overdose Prevention and Intervention Task Force meeting that it is seeking to expand the law’s protections and the categories of people it protects, specifically those with active arrest warrants.<br><br>
And Annajane Yolken, one of the co-chairs of Rhode Island’s Substance Abuse and Overdose Prevention Political Action Committee, wants to expand the law’s protections to cover distributors and manufacturers of narcotic drugs.<br><br>
“Some current weaknesses in the law is that it only covers overdose-related emergencies, and we’d love to see that expanded,” Yolken said. “It seems silly that we should only have people call 911 if it’s an overdose-related emergency but not any medical-related emergency.” If someone was in possession of drugs, she reasons, they should be able to call 911, without fear of prosecution, if the person next to them had a heart attack.<br><br>
During the pandemic, many of those who struggle with substance abuse have not been able to access the health care they need. Overdose deaths in Rhode Island jumped by 22% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, but according to RIDOH, emergency room visits across Rhode Island have decreased by almost 15%.<br><br>
“People are afraid of getting COVID and getting into an ambulance and hospital,” she said.   “There’s a lot we don’t know out there in regards to drug use. It’s going to be interesting to see whether it has an impact overall with the willingness of people to call 911.”<br><br>
With more people using opioids and overdosing alone in their homes during the pandemic and rising protests against law enforcement around the country, overdose prevention activists believe it is more important than ever for opioid users to be aware of the Good Samaritan Law’s protections so they won’t hesitate to call in an emergency.<br><br>
Neronha, for one, wants to reassure the public that his office focuses on treatment rather than incarceration for drug users and addicts. “If you possess narcotics and you have a substance abuse issue and you violate the law,” he said, “we’re going to treat that as a public health issue.”<br><br>
Like Yolken, Bailer believes that the state should be doing more to expand the Good Samaritan Law’s protections. For now, however, his priority is using the law to save as many lives as possible.<br><br>
“Everybody involved is still trying to see the law get better,” he said. “But in the meantime, we still have to make the protections readily known.”<br>
